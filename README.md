# linked-lists
While linked lists are not native to Ruby, you can create them using objects (nodes) with a value and a reference to another node. This program uses a class LinkedList and class Node to create nodes and perform a range of methods: 
- make a new head node
- append a node 
- give the number of nodes in the list, and the head and tail node values
- retrieve any node at a given index value in the list
- pop a tail node off the list
- boolean search of a value in the list
- return the index of the node that has a given value
- insert a new node at given index
- delete a node from a given index
- convert the list into a visual string representation
